# :octocat: Robot Controller

**Robot Controller** is a Python script designed to manage an iRobot Create2 (Roomba) through manual and automatic modes. The script leverages the `pycreate2` library for direct communication with the robot, with real-time data visualization using `matplotlib` and `tkinter` for a GUI.

## Functionality

### 1. **Modes of Operation:**
   - **Manual Mode**: Enables direct control of the robot using keyboard arrows, providing instant movement adjustments and testing flexibility.
   - **Automatic Mode**: Runs the robot on a pre-defined path generated by the A* algorithm with both Euclidean and Manhattan heuristics, ideal for testing route-following capabilities and movement precision.

### 2. **Pathfinding with A* Algorithm**:
   - **A* Pathfinding**: The script uses an A* algorithm to determine the optimal path from a starting position to a defined goal. A* is known for its efficiency in pathfinding by combining a priority queue with cost-tracking to find the shortest path.
   - **Heuristics**:
     - **Manhattan Heuristic**: Used for cardinal (straight) movements, this heuristic calculates the distance in a grid-based environment as the sum of absolute differences in the x and y coordinates.
     - **Euclidean Heuristic**: Used for diagonal movements, this heuristic calculates the straight-line distance to the target, providing more accurate distance estimation for diagonal paths.
   - **Priority Queue Management**: The `a_star()` function initiates a priority queue and tracks node costs, continually updating and comparing neighbors to find the most efficient route.

### 3. **Odometry and Speed Control**:
   - **Position Calculation**: The script continuously updates the robot's position `(x, y)` and orientation using encoder data, calculated through `Odometer`.
   - **Straight Movements**: The robot moves at a speed of 100 or -100 for forward and backward movements.
   - **Rotational Movements**: When rotating, the speed is set to 60 for the left wheel and -60 for the right wheel to achieve a smooth turn.

### 4. **Graphical Visualization (GUI)**:
   - **Interface**: The GUI displays the robot’s current position and orientation, facilitating real-time trajectory tracking.
   - **Trajectory Update**: The interface uses `matplotlib` to plot the ongoing path and `tkinter` for interactive control windows. In manual mode, users can watch the position change with each movement command.

## Main Classes

### `RobotController`

This class handles the connection and communication with the robot, managing both manual and automatic movement. It is also responsible for odometry updates, calculating and visualizing the robot's real-time position.

   - **Attributes**:
     - `self.port`, `self.baud`: Communication port and baud rate for robot connection.
     - `self.bot`: Instance of `Create2` from `pycreate2`, enabling robot interaction.
     - `self.odometer`: An instance of `Odometer` to calculate position based on encoder data.
     - `self.queue`: Queue structure to manage movement commands and data.
     - `self.fig`, `self.ax`: Elements from `matplotlib` for GUI plotting.

   - **Primary Methods**:
     - `initialize_robot()`: Establishes the connection with the robot and sets up the initial GUI configurations, loading the iRobot image and creating the coordinate grid.
     - `manual_control()`: Allows direct movement commands through keyboard inputs.
     - `automatic_control()`: Runs a pre-set series of movements autonomously.
     - `draw_robot()`: Updates the robot's position in the GUI, showing real-time trajectory and orientation.

### `Odometer`

The `Odometer` class handles odometry calculations, enabling precise tracking of position and orientation based on encoder readings.

   - **Attributes**:
     - `self.bot`: Reference to the `Create2` instance.
     - `self.x`, `self.y`: Current coordinates of the robot.
     - `self.angle`: Orientation in radians.

   - **Primary Methods**:
     - `initialize_odometry()`: Sets initial values for position and orientation.
     - `update_odometry()`: Updates `(x, y)` position and `angle` based on encoder readings, calculating distance and rotation traveled.

## Running the Script

1. **Initial Configuration**: Connect the iRobot to the computer’s serial port (default: `COM3`). Modify the port if needed.

2. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   python go.py
